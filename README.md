# General information


This website was formed originally as a learning project
for me to figure out AWS and python a bit more.

However, I recently really wanted to explore Golang
and mongodb, which lead me to rework this pastebin
into a less microservice-y shill site and more of a
cool golang site.

I basically just wanted a way to send files to my
friends without using imgur or a weird anime pastebin.


## End Goal / Milestones

We are basically in the end game, however there are issues
on github for things I think would be cool implemented in
the site.

These things include better CSS.

Further, I am always open to optimizations or better ways
of doing things, so please shoot away.


## How to use this??

Well, its pretty easy, just navigate to the site and upload your file

## How do I contribute?
